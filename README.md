CP468 - Group 15 Term Project 

Overview
This project is an implementation of a collaborative robot coordination system using the A* pathfinding algorithm. It is designed to simulate and manage robot movement within a predefined environment.

File Structure
- AStarPathFinder - Core pathfinding logic
- App.java - Main application entry point
- CollabRobotCoord.java - Robot coordination logic
- Environment.txt - Environment configuration

Features
- A* Pathfinding for optimal route calculation
- Collaborative robot coordination
- Configurable environment

Usage
- Modify Environment.txt to define the environment layout.
- Run the application to simulate robot movement.
- Observe the output for pathfinding and coordination results.
